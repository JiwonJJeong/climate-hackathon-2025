# MyClimate
MyClimate is a dashboard for insurers and individuals to quantify the health and financial incentive in caring about your air environment. For the Climate in Health hackathon, our team, Climate Rodeo, studied datasets and research to train a model predicting climate health risk and expected inpatient cost increases based on personal health and environment risk factors. Then, we created a full stack web app to allow fast use and interpretation of our machine learning model.
