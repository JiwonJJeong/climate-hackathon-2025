# MyClimate
MyClimate is a dashboard for insurers and individuals to quantify the health and financial incentive in caring about your air environment. For the Climate in Health hackathon, our team, Climate Rodeo, studied datasets and research to train a model predicting climate health risk and expected inpatient cost increases based on personal health and environment risk factors. Then, we created a full stack web app to allow fast use and interpretation of our machine learning model.

# Why MyClimate?
Nearly every person on earth breathes unhealthy levels of air pollution every day. Our product puts power in the hands of everyday people to find out how at risk they are for negative health outcomes and gives them the knowledge and tools to protect themselves.

â€‹The risks of air pollution can come from many different places: power plants, vehicle emissions, or even living by an airport or a highway. Wildfire smoke can travel across states, countries, and even oceans. Fires that are thousands of miles away spread harmful byproducts, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), that can reach your home. Some of the most vulnerable groups at risk for negative health outcomes from bad air quality include children and older adults, underemployed and unhoused people, pregnant women, and people with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular diseases.

Current systems neglect to empower their patients with personalized risk assessments. Our predictive dashboard fuses individual health profiles with real-time environmental exposures to forecast hospitalization risk. We envision a world where individuals are empowered with the data they need regarding their environment in relation to their health. Our users will be equipped with the knowledge to prevent escalation of their health conditions, as well as have a deeper understanding of the inextricable relationship between their health and environmental conditions. We are building your next Cli-mate!
